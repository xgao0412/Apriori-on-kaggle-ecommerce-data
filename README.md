# Apriori-on-kaggle-ecommerce-data
This code is showing how to use R to implement association rules, which is used to find frequent itemsets. I came across this concept when reading the book data minining. concepts and techniques. I search for tutorials and find out this one https://datascienceplus.com/implementing-apriori-algorithm-in-r/

First, I will follow this tutorial, then I would like to implement it on the kaggle ecommerce dataset.
